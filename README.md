# Cinematic Boss

Cinematic Boss is a mod that allows you to add a cinematic cool effect when you use a boss offering in the altar.

IMPORTANT: Only the player that makes the offering will receive the cutscene (multiplayer support soon!)

## Usage instructions

There is a default configuration set to be used for a cool boss cutscene without touching the .cfg file.

Any change here will impact that effect in different ways, so feel free to experiment!
